                The Olympics, officially known as the Olympic Games, are an international sporting event held every four years. 
                They bring together athletes from different countries to compete against each other in a variety of sports disciplines. 
                The Olympic Games are governed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which is responsible for selecting the host city, 
                establishing the rules and regulations, and overseeing the event.<br/>

                The modern Olympic Games were inspired by the ancient Olympic Games held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BCE to 
                the 4th century CE. The modern Olympics were first revived in 1896 and have been held regularly since then, with some interruptions
                during periods of war.

                    Sports analysis is the process of examining various aspects of a sporting event or competition in order to gain insights and
                     draw conclusions about the performance of individual players, teams, or strategies. It involves studying statistics,
                     observing game footage, and applying analytical techniques to understand the dynamics and outcomes of the sport.
                     <br/>
                     Overall, sports analysis is a multidisciplinary approach that combines statistical analysis, tactical understanding,
                      and observational skills to provide insights into player and team performance, game strategies, and future outcomes.
                      It is used by coaches, managers, broadcasters, and sports enthusiasts to better understand the game and make informed decisions.
