        qn: 'Explain a Cash Flow Statement.',
        ans: 'First we start with net income, proceed line by line while making adjustments to arrive at cash flows from operations. Now, you will have to mention capital expenditures, purchase of intangible assets, purchase or sale of investment securities, and asset sales to arrive at cash flow from investments. After getting the cash flow from investments, you’ll need to mention issuance or repurchase of equity and debt and paying out dividends to arrive at finances. Then, you need to add cash flows from investments, operations, and financing to get the total change in cash. Finally, the cash balance at the beginning of the period and the change in cash lets you arrive at the cash balance of the period’s end. This is essentially what a cash flow statement looks like. '

        qn: 'What do you Mean by Hedging?',
        ans: "Hedging is a risk management strategy we implement to offset losses in investments. We do so by taking an opposite position in a related asset. However, the amount of risk hedging reduces results in a similar reduction in the potential profit. You can say that hedging is similar to having insurance where you pay a certain premium and get assured compensation. With hedging, if the asset in question causes you a loss, the opposite position in the related asset will make up for this loss. This is why a hedger is quite different from speculators as a hedger doesn’t focus on maximizing profits but on minimizing risks."

        qn: 'Should I Choose a Retail Bank, Credit Union, or Commercial Bank?',
        ans: "You should consider whether you want to keep both business and personal accounts at the same bank, or whether you want them at separate banks. A retail bank, which has basic banking services for customers, is the most appropriate for everyday banking. You can choose a traditional bank, which has a physical building, or an online bank if you don't want or need to physically visit a bank branch. You might consider a credit union, which is a nonprofit institution and is available to serve the needs of people with a common employer, labor union, or professional interest."

        qn: 'Bank vs. Credit Union',
        ans: "Credit unions vary in size from small, community-based entities to larger ones with thousands of branches across the country. Just like banks, credit unions provide routine financial services for their clients, who are generally called members. These services include deposit, withdrawal, and basic credit services. But there are some inherent differences between the two. A bank is a profit-driven entity, while a credit union is a nonprofit organization traditionally run by volunteers. Created, owned, and operated by participants, they are generally tax-exempt. Members purchase shares in the co-op, and that money is pooled together to provide a credit union's credit services. Because they are smaller entities, they tend to provide a limited range of services compared to banks. They also have fewer locations and automated teller machines (ATMs)."

        qn: 'What is Sales, Trading & Structuring?',
        ans: "When people think of investment banking, they tend to imagine the trading floor. Although sales, trading and structuring is just one part of a bank’s work, it is where a lot of its commercial activities take place. In simple terms, traders buy and sell products like debt (bonds) and commodities (like oil and natural gas) and execute foreign exchange deals to make an incremental profit and/or hedge risk. At Deutsche Bank, roles in our FIC (Fixed Income and Currencies) business can largely be broken down into three areas:"

        qn: 'What skills do you need for Sales Trading?',
        ans: 'If you want to work in sales and trading, you will need to be analytical, with an ability to draw together disparate information to form a bigger picture. "A good analyst-level trader knows how to research the market to gather information. A great one knows how to piece all this information together to extract meaningful data and trends," says Yeoh Choo Guan, head of equities Singapore at UBS.  Yeoh says you will need a, "strong methodical and analytical" mind: "There is a lot of information and data which you will encounter...You will face many questions covering trends, correlations, causal relationships."'
